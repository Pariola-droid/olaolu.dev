It’s the 31st of December 2018, and the last day of the year. I almost did not
write this piece as I’ve been busy planning for the new year and of course lazy
to write as always. Anyways, here it is!

It’s been a great and also very challenging year. Like every year, I was less
noisy on social media. A bit of me thinks I was a little bit quieter this year
though, the other thinks no.

A huge part of my 2018 was wasted schooling though until I realized it wasn’t
worth it, and that I was only losing on both sides (schooling and career). I
should tell the full story some day if it’s not too boring.

## Schooling in UNILAG, time “well wasted”

I started off the year a student at the Univeristy of Lagos. The whole
registration and matriculation process was very stressful and frustrating, but
after that, it was real fun — met new people, made friends, explored the
environment and hung out.

It was great until the very day I had my first lecture, it dawned on me that I
was in the wrong place: a lot was wrong, I was lost, I was studying a course I
didn’t like at all — History and Strategic Studies, it was tough for me. I
paused, I thought, I tried again, it didn’t work. Studying that course was the
only thing I’ve ever committed to that I felt so wrong about — the only time I
knew “depression”.

At the end of the first semester, I gathered courage and told my parents how I
felt about it and that I couldn’t continue — it was tough, but after several
meetings and calls, they really understood me, they knew that I’ve always been
very focused and ambitious, and they had heard from several people and witnessed
my “exploits”.

They were proud of me and they agreed that I quit the course, even though they
later felt uncomfortable about it and asked me to try again the next semester,
it failed again. Anyways, I left finally, after being destabilized initially, I
got my energy back quickly, I was free. I vowed to take the rest of the year by
storm — getting back on track and focusing on achieving my goals. I’m taking a
break off schooling and I’m never returning to that school or course. I have
plans to study abroad, but I’m still not ready.

## Building the world’s “biggest” React application

On the 26th day of May, I got a message on Twitter from someone who wanted me to
join a Russian startup he was CTO of. It wasn’t strange, I had gotten (and still
get) several offers from people around the world wanting me to join their
company or come collaborate with them which I’ve always turned down, or for
some, don’t take seriously. This one was different, he persisted, we spoke over
the phone, he said he had been following me for about a year and had always
looked forward to working with me.

So, I decided to check their site and found that the frontend design and
infrastructure was a mess, I wanted my magic to be felt, I wanted to make an
impact. After much negotiation and me being disinclined by their proposal, I
took up the job. I wrote a
[redesign proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jl72mN3IvXzw0rAIT607MGTrtHS1QP8blejRi9lC090/edit?usp=sharing)
after much analysis of the site and started work in June as the Lead frontend
developer.

I achieved a lot in the first month, and they were extremely overwhelmed by the
quality of my work and how committed I was to it. Some of the milestones I
reached include building a real messaging system from the ground up, cutting
down bundle size by over 80%, improving the development workflow
[amongst others](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gw4mcURKddzOJ7OoZsMghJDAhW5zMXler4EeOY9BP6E/edit?usp=sharing).

I also got to hire and work with my friends and favorite JavaScript developers:
Ademola and Ekene because it was a lot for me to handle alone. We learnt a lot
from each other working at [Conectar](https://conectar.ru). It was an amazing
experience and great working on an application powered by six languages, or
eight if you classify Rails and React separate languages. It was filled with
challenges as I had to build several real-world applications into one platform.

## Letting go of a final-stage job opportunity at GitLab

In between the six months at Conectar, I spoke with Sarah Drasner and as kind as
she always is, she helped me tweet, I got a lot of opportunities from that to
join great teams including Twitter and GitLab.

The interview started the next day after I sent my résumé to the GitLab
employee. We had a great discussion and we kept in touch. I had about seven
interviews with three of their employees: the recruiter, the engineering
manager, and a team member… all of which were very successful. I passed all the
tests and questions, technical and non-technical.

I had imagined working at GitLab, in fact, we had agreed on the salary — it was
quite huge and I was excited! I surprised them at every stage of the interview
with how much information I had gathered about GitLab and the product the team I
was about to be hired on was building.

The duration of the interviews and the whole length of the process was tiring
and discouraging. I started to lose hope: I became less concerned about it, and
more interested in other interviews from the numerous opportunities I got from
Sarah’s tweet. I didn’t keep in touch with him, I knew the team was always very
busy.

I was making progress with my other interviews too. And then we had a call one
day, he told me they wouldn’t be needing someone who’s more of a frontend
developer in that role at the moment and that they would in a month or two
because they hadn’t gotten an MVP ready yet. From that moment, I tuned my mind
off it and zeroed in on all the other opportunities, and that was how I let go
of the GitLab offer.

## The perfect job

I’ve always wanted something very flexible, and so towards the end of October, I
took up an opportunity to work with a team of the greatest frontend developers
from around the world. Yes, we’re an all-front-end team that’s been around for
almost a decade. I didn’t go through any formal interview process. Not even one
technical interview. It was just a talk with the CEO over Google Meet, and I got
my first project! It was an easy one. I got to work with Next.js and React, and
of course with my usual Sass awesomeness.

I was quick, took me about a week to complete, and they were amazed on how
quickly I was able to complete it and how great it was. They loved it! I got
paid, and it was even more rewarding than my full-time role at the Russian
startup.

I think a week or couple of days later, I got my second project, building a
React application for [John Deere](https://www.google.com/search?q=John+Deere),
a multi-billion dollar corporation in the US that has been in existence since
the 19th century. This is really huge for me, and it’s been a little challenging
too, but it’s really great. Still a work in progress though. I’m really humbled
and glad that I was trusted in less than a month to handle the project for a
client that huge. It’s been super tasking working with an agency that works
directly for them too. There’s always a lot of work and changes to make.

I’m so excited about this and I love the team so much! Everyone is friendly and
amazing! The whole team is focused and very energetic. We’re about greatness!

## TL;DR & Other highlights

About goals for the year, I was able to achieve most of my goals for the year
aside being very much involved in the Nigerian techosystem (speaking and
contributing) — majorly because I was destabilized at the beginning of the year,
even though I contributed a little in making some tech events in my school and
most significantly, [Concatenate Conf](https://concatenate.io/) a success! Huge
props to my very great friend, Christian Nwamba and others.

Also, I didn’t get the chance to master TypeScript and I wasn’t able to publish
all of my local screencasts. I plan to set up properly in 2019 and record new
and amazing ones!

## Quick highlights from 2018…

In all, 2018 was amazing! I had great experiences, opportunities and learnt
whole a lot.

**Personal**

- Quit schooling at UNILAG — Schooling there was the worst thing ever!
- Made new friends
- I was very silent on social media
- Attended a few concerts
- Tried 3 new haircuts. I think
  [this one](https://res.cloudinary.com/dqsuy3rzt/image/upload/v1546385137/D9C298A7-7B2B-474E-827E-559796F63A58_dkt1ft.jpg)
  was the best, but my mum says putting on spikes is “irresponsible” :(
- Explored “funtography” (I coined that term)
- Took 100x pictures of myself than I did in 2017.
- Had a great birthday!
- Made really amazing new friends too!
- Got myself a brand new power laptop — it’s beautiful!
- Ate a lot of junk food (this is very unhealthy, do not attempt it). I hope
  this doesn’t happen again LOL
- Did some saving and investing! Would definitely be a lot better in the new
  year.

**Tech and Work**

- Made
  [1,258 contributions](https://github.com/whizkydee?tab=overview&from=2018-10-01&to=2018-10-31)
  on GitHub

  lightweight JavaScript “reverse” utility
- Worked 100% remote just like every year
- Offered to
  [mentor frontend developers](https://twitter.com/mrolaolu/status/979123407915769862).
  That tweet blew up a lot more than I had planned. I got over 100 requests. I
  was only able to pick less than 10%, directed some to other great developers,
  and the rest are several pending message requests on Twitter which I’m not so
  happy about.
- Launched my personal “mini” site, [olaolu.me](https://olaolu.me). People love
  it! Also, a lot of people have either stolen ideas from there or told me they
  learnt a bunch from it.
- Home tutored and mentored a 14.yo on JavaScript and frontend web development.
  From this
  [very ridiculous question](https://www.instagram.com/p/BfXqUQtgpOHIDJlnt88V26VptME2t08V1N1Rgc0/)
  he asked when I started out with him to him being able to build great plain
  JavaScript applications, explain how the interpreter works, and even provide
  solution to challenges like
  [fizzbuzz](https://www.google.com/search?q=fizzbuzz+javascript). This has been
  one of my greatest achievements in 2018 and is still a mystery to me. I’m
  super proud of him and myself!
- Attended a bunch of tech events
- My [VS Code theme](https://bit.ly/palenight-theme) crossed 300,000 downloads
- Sarah’s awesome [Night Owl theme](http://aka.ms/night-owl) was born from mine
- Improved my JavaScript skills a whole lot
- Let go of a huge opportunity at GitLab
- Worked for six months as a Lead Frontend Developer at
  [Conectar](https://conectar.ru)
- Led a team of frontend developers building one of the biggest React
  applications in the world.
- Got the best job ever! I like the team and the flexibility.
- Got to build an application for a multi-billion dollar corporation in the US

Thanks to you and to everyone who made my 2018 story (the real one). To everyone
who inspired and motivated me, thank you! Let’s do this again with even more
energy! There’s a whole lot more I prolly can’t remember or don’t want to write.
I think this article is already too long and boring, isn’t it?

## What’s next?

I really really hope I’m not too lazy to write an article about this. I actually
want to write one. But of course, it’s going to be about being better.

However, if you liked this “long, boring article”, please clap as many times as
you can _grins_ and feel free to share with someone: your friend or somebody,
they might like it too.

Banger! DadaDang! (in Speed Darlington’s voice, if you know who that is anyways)

_Thank you!_
